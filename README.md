Reflection: why you did the project, what you learned throughout the process, etc.

This project was menat to acess your knowledge and comprehensiveness of Basic Web Design tools such as HTML and CSS. If you were sucessful in creating a page of a website using the knowledge attained from both tools, then it can be implied that you know enough of HTML and CSS to move on to Advanced Web Design. Throughout this project, I learned many things- mainly not to procrastinate. I thought I would have enough time to complete this project, but every single day I attempted to do so, issues came up whether it was more important homework or sibling troubles. Apart from that, I learned how to use the keyframe and hover syntax. Throughout this process I was able to break apart the large task of recreating a website and making the task a bit more managable. I did so by creating an outline of what I had to do and when I had to do it. If I were to follow through with the outlined plan, I wouldn't be in my bed right now at 3:30 in the morning trying to finish this assignment. Key frames, gradients, and hovering were hard topics to address. I looked at other people code through said topics through sources like Stack Overflow, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21561286/interpreting-css3-linear-gradient, and Youtube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNrx_hCbwfI, to find out solutions to do the portion of the website that dealt with them.
